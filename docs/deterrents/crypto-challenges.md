# Cryptographic challenges

- PoW or PoS alone might not be enough if the adversary has devices that are more powerful than the average user's.
- CPU-, memory-, and storage-bound protocols are more resistant to ASICs and FPGAs.

## Recommended protocols

### Proof of Work

- [Equi-X](https://github.com/tevador/equix).
- Guided tour puzzle protocol

### Proof of Space (PoS)

### Proof of Spacetime (PoSt)

## Emerging protocols

### Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs)

## Inadvisable protocols

- Hashcash. Uses SHA-1.
- Client Puzzle Protocol. Verification is expensive compared to other PoW protocols.
