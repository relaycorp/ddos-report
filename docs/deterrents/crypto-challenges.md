# Cryptographic challenges

- Proof of Work.
  - [Equi-X](https://github.com/tevador/equix).
  - Guided tour puzzle protocol
- Proof of Space.
- Proof of Spacetime.

## Considerations

- PoW or PoS alone might not be enough if the adversary has devices that are more powerful than the average user's.
- CPU-, memory-, and storage-bound protocols are more resistant to ASICs and FPGAs.

## Protocols that we don't recommend

- Hashcash. Uses SHA-1.
- Client Puzzle Protocol. Verification is expensive compared to other PoW protocols.
