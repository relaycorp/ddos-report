# Protect anonymous services from DDoS attacks

_Anonymous services_ are those that don't require users to authenticate themselves, although in some cases they may support authentication to unlock additional features. These services play a crucial role in decentralised systems, ensuring that users aren't priced out or forced to provide personally identifiable information. Examples include:

- DNS resolvers, like Cloudflare's `1.1.1.1` or Google's `8.8.8.8`
- STUN servers, like `stun.l.google.com:19305` or `stun.ekiga.net:3478
  `.
- Blockchain gateways, like Cloudflare's Ethereum endpoint `https://cloudflare-eth.com` or Protocol Labs' IPFS gateway `https://ipfs.io`.
- Tor (guard) relays.
- Awala Internet Gateways, like Relaycorp's `belgium.relaycorp.services`.

Such services are almost exclusively operated by either volunteers with a desire to contribute to the public good,
or companies that have a vested interest in the success of the ecosystem. Typically, only the later have the financial and organisational capacity to prepare for and cope with DDoS attacks.
