# DDoS mitigations by system type

Every system should fall into at least one of these categories. For example, an IMAP server would only fall into the [authenticated server](./authenticated) category, but Awala would fall into the [federated](./federated.md) and [public goods](./public-goods.md) categories.

Because we're only interested in DDoS attacks over the Internet, systems like intranet servers (running behind a firewall or VPC) and mesh networks are outside the scope of this document.
