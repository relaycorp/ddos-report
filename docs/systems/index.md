# Systems vulnerable to DDoS attacks

Every system should fall into at least one of these categories. For example, an IMAP server would only fall into the [authenticated server](./authenticated-servers.md) category, but Awala would fall into the [federated](./federated.md) and [public goods](./public-goods.md) categories.

Because we're only interested in DDoS attacks over the Internet, systems like intranet servers (running behind a firewall or VPC) and meshnets are outside the scope of this document.
