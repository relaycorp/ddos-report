# Inadvisable mitigations

## DDoS scrubbing services

## Proof of Personhood

The field is promising, but plagued by dodgy Blockchain projects.

- [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/).
- [Civic Pass](https://www.civic.com/).
- [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/).
- [World Id](https://worldcoin.org/world-id) (Worldcoin).

No need for Blockchain, no need for token. Alternatives: PKI with certificate transparency, or at least solve the DDoS problem with low-tech solutions like better KYC from ISPs and cybersecurity regulations.
