title: About The DDoS Report
---

The DDoS Report is a living resource that aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the DDoS threat landscape and the state of the art in DDoS defences.

## Motivation

At [Relaycorp](https://relaycorp.tech),
we set out to understand the DDoS threat landscape and devise defences for our decentralised protocols.
As we worked through the problem and how to solve it,
we realised that,
to facilitate an independent assessment of our proposed solution ([Despacito](https://despacito.bot)),
we needed to clearly delimit the problem space and our solution.
