title: About The DDoS Report
prev: false

The DDoS Report is a living resource that aims
to provide app developers and operators with an [overview of the DDoS threat landscape](./overview.md) and [the state of the art in DDoS defence](mitigation.md).

## Motivation

At [Relaycorp](https://relaycorp.tech),
we set out to develop DDoS mitigation mechanisms for our decentralised protocols.
In doing so,
we recognised the need for a strict distinction between the problem **as we understand it** and potential solutions,
to facilitate an unbiased review of our solution.

This website is the output of our research.
Apart from helping other app developers and operators,
we hope to use it to validate our understanding of the problem â€”
irrespective of how we solve it in our projects.
