The following mitigations should prove very effective against DDoS attacks on public, static websites:

- [Reverse proxy](../mitigations/reverse-proxies.md). Make sure to host the static content on a service like Amazon S3 or GitHub Pages, and enable caching in your reverse proxy.
- [Unmetered DNS lookups](../mitigations/unmetered-dns.md).
- [Cloud resource limits](../mitigations/resource-limits.md). [Static websites are very much susceptible to DoW attacks](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39520776).

To protect any dynamic or sensitive content, such as APIs, consider the mitigations in [authenticated systems](ted.md).
