## DDoS attacks deserve more attention

**Anyone with a web browser can launch a DDoS attack today**.
Accessing the _Dark Web_ is not even necessary â€”
a Google search will reveal services that allow clients to launch such attacks anonymously for a small fee,
with some even offering free trials.

Unsurprisingly,
[**DDoS attacks are on the rise at an alarming rate**](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/ddos-attacks-surge-cloudflare/704011/),
a trend that may worsen with the increase in Internet connectivity and bandwidth,
and the proliferation of vulnerable IoT devices.
Until now, [CAPTCHAs](./mitigations/captchas.md) have been effective in deterring malicious bots,
but [proprietary AI systems can already solve them](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/sob-story-about-dead-grandma-tricks-microsoft-ai-into-solving-captcha/),
and it might only be a matter of time before open source AI models can do the same on a larger scale.

These attacks not only infringe on our freedom but also have a significant financial impact.
Anyone with an online presence,
from [hobbyists](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39520776) to [Fortune 500 companies](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ransom-ddos-attacks-target-a-fortune-global-500-company),
can be a target.
Furthermore, they pose a threat to the decentralisation of the Internet,
as only well-resourced companies can afford to operate and protect the [public goods](./systems/public-goods.md) on which we all depend.

**App developers and operators can't _avoid_ DDoS attacks, but they can _greatly minimise_ their impact**.
[Proxies](./mitigations/reverse-proxies.md) from the likes of Akamai and Cloudflare are a good starting point,
but they must be complimented with other [mitigation techniques](./mitigations) depending on the [system type](./systems).

## Help wanted

We're eager to get feedback from companies with vantage points on DDoS attacks and security researchers.
If you believe we have misrepresented any information, overlooked details relevant to app developers or operators,
or if you can answer some of our [open questions](./open-questions.md),
please share your thoughts on our [forum](https://github.com/relaycorp/ddos-report/discussions).
