**Reporting IP addresses and other network resources used to target your systems might eventually end abuse**,
even though it won't happen instantly.
At the very least,
it may help others protect themselves from the same actors.

## IP address

IP addresses sending DDoS traffic to your systems can be reported to their ISP or cloud provider,
and/or organisations that maintain blocklists.

To report an IP address to its ISP or cloud provider,
go to [RIPEstat](https://stat.ripe.net/app/launchpad) and look up the address.
You can then email the _Abuse Contact_ listed on the resulting page.

IP addresses involved in DDoS attacks can also be reported to
[AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/report) and/or [Spamhaus](https://submit.spamhaus.org/submit).

## Participants in decentralised systems

Decentralised systems (e.g. federated social networks)
may leverage [authentication](./authentication.md) to identify and report abusive participants
in purpose-built blocklists.

## Law enforcement

DDoS attacks are illegal in many jurisdictions, and can therefore be reported to law enforcement.
For example,
in the UK and the US,
attacks should be reported to the [National Cyber Security Centre](https://report.ncsc.gov.uk) and
the [Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)](https://www.ic3.gov),
respectively.
