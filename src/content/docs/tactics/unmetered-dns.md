DNS servers may be the target or collateral damage of a DDoS attack.
This can cause a significant increase in the number of DNS lookups,
which can lead to increased costs.

To mitigate this, you should use a DNS provider that offers unmetered DNS lookups.
Many cloud-based [reverse proxy](./reverse-proxies.md) services offer this feature.
