No single tool or technique will be enough on its own,
but a combination of them can make it more difficult for abusers to exploit your service.
This section aims to describe all the possible mitigation tactics against DDoS attacks.
If you're aware of a tool or technique that we don't explicitly recommend or advise against,
please [let us know](https://github.com/relaycorp/ddos-report/discussions).
