No mitigation will be enough on its own,
but a combination of mitigations can make it more difficult for abusers to exploit your service.
This section aims to describe all the possible mitigations against DDoS attacks,
and their advantages and disadvantages.

This is meant to be a comprehensive list of mitigation strategies.
If you are aware of a strategy that we don't explicitly recommend or advise against,
please [let us know](https://github.com/relaycorp/ddos-report/discussions).
